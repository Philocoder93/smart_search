# Project 2 Evaluation

## Technical Requirements
**3: Excelling**
> The app contains 4 models and implements user authentication, which goes beyond the technical requirements. Additionally, nice job implementing many-to-many.

## Creativity and Interface
**2: Progressing**
> There's some styling, but I'd definitely put in more before you present this. At least use Flexbox to get rid of that white space around your header and footer.

## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
> Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

## Deployment and Functionality
**3: Excelling**
> Application was successfully deployed.

## Planning / Process / Submission
**3: Excelling**
> Submission includes everything in previous category, as well as evidence of planning tools, including Trello. The pseudocode justifying your decisions is also strong. You might wanna include language talking about what you'll see in the different branches you have there. I was a little confused when I tried to run your app on the master branch and saw no routes there.
